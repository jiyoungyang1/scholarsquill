# Prompt for Analyzing Problem Expression Language in Research Literature

## Task Instructions

Analyze the provided research documents to identify the specific language patterns, phrases, and expressions that researchers use to articulate and frame problems and value in their field. Focus exclusively on **how** problems and the value are expressed linguistically, not **what** the problems are about.

## Analysis Framework

Extract and categorize the language expressions into two main categories:

### Category 1: Expressing Instability/Technical Problems

Look for linguistic patterns used to state:

- Technical challenges and limitations
- Methodological inadequacies
- Computational difficulties
- Experimental constraints
- Validation issues

### Category 2: Expressing Cost/Benefit 

Look for linguistic patterns used to state:

- Technical/Scientific concerns and resource issues
- Efficiency problemsy<a
- Development timeline challenges
- Resource allocation difficulties
- Performance optimization needs

## What to Extract

Focus on:

- **Specific phrases and expressions** used to introduce problems
- **Linguistic patterns** for framing limitations
- **Rhetorical strategies** for emphasizing problem severity
- **Comparative language** used to contrast with existing solutions
- **Temporal framing** language (past challenges, current needs, future benefits)
- **Quantitative expressions** used to describe problem scale
- **Authority/evidence language** used to validate problem statements

## What NOT to Extract

Avoid:

- The technical content or subject matter of the problems
- Detailed explanations of methodologies or solutions
- Background scientific information
- Results or findings
- Purely descriptive content without problem framing

## Output Format

Organize findings as:

1. **Direct quotes** showing how problems are linguistically framed
2. **Language patterns** grouped by rhetorical function
3. **Expression categories** showing different ways the same type of problem is articulated
4. **Linguistic strategies** used to establish problem importance and urgency

## Key Questions to Guide Analysis

- How do authors introduce limitations and challenges?
- What language patterns signal problem statements?
- How do they establish problem severity and importance?
- What comparative language do they use?
- How do they frame the need for their solutions?
- What quantitative language do they use for problem scale?
