# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The scholarsquill MCP server is a new, standalone Model Context Protocol server built from scratch that enables automated processing of scientific papers in PDF format to generate structured markdown literature notes. This server will be developed as an independent project in the scholarsquill directory, providing seamless academic research support through standardized note-taking templates and batch processing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to process individual PDF papers into structured markdown notes, so that I can quickly extract key information and maintain consistent documentation across my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls `/sq:note [target]` THEN the system SHALL read the specified PDF file and extract its content
2. WHEN processing a PDF THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including title, authors, publication year, and DOI if available
3. WHEN generating notes THEN the system SHALL create a markdown file following the literature review template structure
4. IF the PDF cannot be read THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the issue
5. WHEN note generation is complete THEN the system SHALL return the path to the generated markdown file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to specify different focus areas for note generation, so that I can tailor the analysis to my specific research needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies `--focus research` THEN the system SHALL emphasize practical applications and research methodologies
2. WHEN a user specifies `--focus theory` THEN the system SHALL emphasize theoretical frameworks, equations, and mathematical models
3. WHEN a user specifies `--focus review` THEN the system SHALL follow the comprehensive literature review template format
4. WHEN a user specifies `--focus method` THEN the system SHALL emphasize methodological approaches and experimental procedures
5. IF no focus is specified THEN the system SHALL default to a balanced analysis covering all aspects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to control the depth of analysis, so that I can balance thoroughness with processing time based on my immediate needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies `--depth quick` THEN the system SHALL generate concise notes focusing on key points and main contributions
2. WHEN a user specifies `--depth deep` THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive notes with detailed analysis and cross-references
3. IF no depth is specified THEN the system SHALL default to standard depth analysis
4. WHEN using quick depth THEN the system SHALL complete processing in under 30 seconds per paper
5. WHEN using deep depth THEN the system SHALL include detailed equation analysis and theoretical context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to process multiple PDF files in batch mode, so that I can efficiently generate notes for entire collections of papers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies `--batch yes` with a directory path THEN the system SHALL process all PDF files in the specified directory
2. WHEN processing in batch mode THEN the system SHALL generate individual markdown files for each PDF
3. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates showing current file being processed
4. IF any PDF fails to process in batch mode THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining files and report errors at the end
5. WHEN batch processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of successful and failed conversions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the generated notes to follow consistent markdown formatting, so that they integrate seamlessly with my existing note-taking system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating notes THEN the system SHALL use standard markdown formatting with proper headers, lists, and code blocks
2. WHEN including equations THEN the system SHALL format them using LaTeX syntax within markdown
3. WHEN creating file names THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention based on author and year
4. WHEN generating notes THEN the system SHALL include proper citation information and metadata at the top
5. IF custom formatting is specified THEN the system SHALL apply the requested format while maintaining readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the MCP server to have robust PDF processing capabilities built from scratch, so that I can reliably extract content from scientific papers without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL implement its own PDF text extraction using libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
2. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL implement custom analysis logic for scientific paper structure
3. WHEN generating templates THEN the system SHALL include built-in templates for different note-taking styles
4. IF PDF processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN handling different PDF formats THEN the system SHALL support both text-based and OCR-scanned documents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow standard MCP protocol specifications, so that it integrates properly with Kiro and other MCP-compatible tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL register all available tools following MCP protocol standards
2. WHEN receiving tool calls THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and return properly formatted responses
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard MCP error responses with appropriate error codes
4. WHEN the server is queried THEN it SHALL provide proper tool descriptions and parameter specifications
5. IF the server cannot start THEN it SHALL log clear error messages indicating the configuration issue
