## Task Instructions

Analyze academic paragraphs to identify the specific linguistic expressions, connectors, and rhetorical patterns that create **structure** and **flow** within paragraphs. Focus on the language "code" that researchers use to organize ideas, create relationships between concepts, and guide readers through logical progression.

## Analysis Framework

Extract structural expressions in four main categories:

### Category 1: Contrast and Opposition Language

**Purpose**: Language that sets up comparisons, shows differences, or establishes competing ideas

Look for patterns that:
- Signal limitations vs. capabilities
- Compare traditional vs. new approaches  
- Highlight contradictions or paradoxes
- Establish "problem-solution" dynamics

**Examples to identify**:
- "While X shows promise, Y remains challenging"
- "In contrast to traditional methods..."
- "This approach circumvents the limitation..."
- "Unlike previous work..."

### Category 2: Progressive Building Language  

**Purpose**: Language that accumulates evidence, builds momentum, or creates escalating impact

Look for patterns that:
- Connect sequential achievements
- Build from simple to complex examples
- Show temporal progression
- Escalate significance or difficulty

**Examples to identify**:
- "Building on this success..."
- "Taking this further..."  
- "More remarkably..."
- "Perhaps most impressively..."

### Category 3: Connection and Integration Language

**Purpose**: Language that links ideas, synthesizes information, or bridges concepts

Look for patterns that:
- Link related findings
- Connect different studies or approaches  
- Integrate diverse evidence
- Bridge theoretical and practical aspects

**Examples to identify**:
- "Similarly..."
- "In a complementary approach..."
- "This finding, combined with..."
- "Together, these results..."

### Category 4: Emphasis and Evaluation Language

**Purpose**: Language that highlights importance, guides reader interpretation, or signals significance

Look for patterns that:
- Mark critical insights
- Evaluate relative importance
- Signal breakthrough moments
- Guide reader attention

**Examples to identify**:
- "Particularly noteworthy..."
- "The key breakthrough came..."
- "Most convincingly..."
- "This proves particularly valuable for..."

## Structural Flow Analysis

### Flow Pattern Recognition

Identify how expressions create specific paragraph architectures:

#### A. **Accumulating Impact Structure**
- Opening power claims
- Progressive building connectors ("Building on this", "Pushing further")
- Escalating evidence markers
- Synthesis conclusions

#### B. **Problem-Victory Structure**  
- Problem establishment language
- Solution introduction phrases
- Evidence accumulation patterns
- Success evaluation expressions

#### C. **Diverse Applications Structure**
- Versatility framing language
- Parallel structure markers ("In X...", "For Y...", "Even in Z...")
- Breadth demonstration phrases
- Synthesis of range evidence

## What to Extract

Focus on:

### Structural Connectors
- **Sequential connectors**: First, next, then, subsequently
- **Logical connectors**: Therefore, consequently, as a result
- **Temporal connectors**: Recently, previously, currently
- **Evaluative connectors**: Notably, remarkably, importantly

### Relationship Builders  
- **Causal language**: Due to, resulting in, leading to
- **Comparative language**: In contrast, similarly, unlike
- **Additive language**: Furthermore, additionally, moreover
- **Qualifying language**: However, nevertheless, although

### Position Markers
- **Opening signals**: The key challenge, One approach, Recent advances
- **Development signals**: This enabled, Building from, Extending this
- **Peak signals**: Most impressively, Perhaps most convincing, The breakthrough
- **Closing signals**: Together these, Collectively, These successes establish

### Evidence Orchestration Language
- **Citation integration**: As demonstrated by, Studies show, Evidence indicates
- **Quantitative framing**: X-fold improvement, Orders of magnitude, Significantly
- **Scope definition**: Across diverse, In multiple systems, Consistently
- **Impact assessment**: Fundamental shift, Paradigm change, New possibilities

## What NOT to Extract

Avoid:
- The technical content or scientific details
- Specific methodological descriptions  
- Results and data interpretation
- Background information without structural function
- Simple descriptive language without rhetorical purpose

## Output Format

Organize findings as:

### 1. **Structural Expression Categories**
Group expressions by their structural function (contrast, building, connection, emphasis)

### 2. **Flow Architecture Patterns**  
Identify complete structural templates showing how expressions work together

### 3. **Position-Specific Language**
Map expressions to their typical positions (opening, developing, climaxing, concluding)

### 4. **Rhetorical Function Analysis**
Show how specific expressions guide reader interpretation and create paragraph coherence

## Key Questions to Guide Analysis

### Structural Function Questions:
- How do authors signal relationships between ideas?
- What language creates logical progression through a paragraph?
- How do writers guide reader attention and interpretation?
- What expressions create momentum and build toward conclusions?

### Flow Architecture Questions:
- What linguistic patterns create different paragraph structures?
- How do opening and closing expressions frame the middle content?
- What connectors create seamless transitions between evidence points?
- How do writers synthesize multiple pieces of evidence into unified arguments?

### Reader Guidance Questions:
- What expressions signal relative importance of information?
- How do authors prepare readers for key insights?
- What language helps readers follow complex logical development?
- How do structural expressions create anticipation and resolution?

## Expected Output Structure

```
## Contrast Language Codes
- [Direct quotes showing opposition/comparison patterns]
- [Analysis of how these create structural tension]

## Progressive Building Codes  
- [Sequential development expressions]
- [Escalation and momentum patterns]

## Connection Integration Codes

```

This analysis will reveal the "structural DNA" of effective academic paragraphsâ€”the specific language code that creates coherent, compelling argument flow.
